    Face Recognition program for InMoov
    
    Pi² Project ESILV 2017-2018 Team 28
    
    Made by Martin Jérémy, Guillaume Thomas, Mézouar Chloé et Ekhteraei Aria.
    
    Our project is for the humanoïd InMoov Robot, we had to implement a face recognition that is able to 
    recognize around 50 differents persons and able to ask if there is an unknown person who wants to be add.
